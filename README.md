# eXtensible Forward Time SIMulator


`xftsim` simulates complex phenotype/genotype data with an emphasis on short timescale phenomena. `xftsim` is designed with two primary goals:

 - make it easy for statistical geneticists to perform reproducible and systematic sensitivity analyses  to better limitations and assumptions

 - enable evaulation of methods for analyzing "complex traits" under realistically complex generative models
