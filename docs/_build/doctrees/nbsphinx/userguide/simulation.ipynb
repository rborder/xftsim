    "Briefly, these components serve the following purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Founder haplotypes** are the initial haplotypes we seed our simulation with. These can be synthetic or derived from real world data.\n",
    " - **Mating regimes** determine mate assignments and the number of offspring per mating pair\n",
    " - **Recombination maps** determine the probability of recombination events during meiosis. These can be synthetic or derived from empirical maps\n",
    " - **Phenogenetic archtectures** dictate the creation of phenotypic components. These are the most complex objects of the bunch.\n",
    " - **Statistics** include any information we'd like to record or estimate each generation of simulation. These aren't necessary but are often useful. \n",
    " - **Post-processors** specify any non-statistical procedures we'd like to perform each generation such as writing data to disk and limiting memory. Like statistics, these too are optional.\n",
    " \n",
    "We'll go through all of these in detail in the following sections."
